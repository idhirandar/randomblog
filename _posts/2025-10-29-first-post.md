title: "My First Blog Post"

Today I set up my **own blog using GitHub Pages** and **Markdown** â€” no HTML needed!

### Steps I followed
1. Created a repo named `randomblog.github.io`
2. Added `_config.yml`, `index.md`, and a `_posts/` folder
3. Committed and pushed to GitHub

### Next Goals
- Write short, focused posts (one topic per post)
- Cover Linux, Nginx, and container tricks
- Share real-world sysadmin experiences

Stay tuned! ðŸš€
